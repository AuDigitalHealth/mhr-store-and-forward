# Store and Forward 

This folder contains both a S&F Client and S&F Windows Service.

This project can be opened in Visual Studio 2015 and above.
It uses .net f/w 4.6.2

To compile the complete solution, the computer needs internet access
to download the nuget packages.

Node.js also needs to be installed for the Ui Sample.
This can be done by running the following command in the \StoreAndForward.Sample.Ui folder
# npm install

The Service should be installed first.

Then the Sample Console or Ui can be run having configured the endpoints to point 
to the service.

For more information about running the client, look at the documentation in 
the Sample.cs file in the StoreAndForward.Sample.Console Project
